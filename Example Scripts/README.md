# Example Scripts

This directory contains example scripts for three different programming languages: CSharp, Javascript, and Python. Each subdirectory demonstrates how to use the Profinity scripting environment in that language, including basic script execution, service lifecycle management, CAN bus communication, error handling, and cancellation. These examples are intended to help developers get started with Profinity scripting and understand common patterns and error scenarios.

## Subdirectories

---

**[CSharp/](CSharp/README.md)**

Contains example C# scripts that showcase the use of the Profinity scripting API. The scripts demonstrate standard output and error handling, service lifecycle methods, CAN bus message sending and receiving, intentional errors, and script cancellation. Each script is documented in detail in the subdirectory's README.

---

**[Javascript/](Javascript/README.md)**

Provides example Javascript scripts for the Profinity environment. These scripts cover similar topics as the CSharp examples, including output, error handling, service lifecycle, CAN bus communication, and error scenarios. See the subdirectory's README for detailed descriptions of each script.

---

**[Python/](Python/README.md)**

Features example Python scripts that illustrate how to interact with the Profinity scripting API. The examples include basic script execution, service lifecycle management, CAN bus messaging, error handling, and cancellation. Each script is described in the subdirectory's README.
